# [NeurIPS2022] TreeMoCo: Contrastive Neuron Morphology Representation Learning


Abstract

    Morphology of neuron trees is a key indicator to delineate neuronal cell-types, analyze brain development process, 
    and evaluate pathological changes in neurological diseases. Traditional analysis mostly relies on heuristic features 
    and visual inspections. A quantitative, informative, and comprehensive representation of neuron morphology is largely 
    absent but desired. To fill this gap, in this work, we adopt a Tree-LSTM network to encode neuron morphology and 
    introduce a self-supervised learning framework named \OURS to learn features without the need for labels. 
    We test \OURS on 2403 high-quality 3D neuron reconstructions of mouse brains from three different public resources. 
    Our results show that \OURS is effective in both classifying major brain cell-types and identifying sub-types. 
    To our best knowledge, \OURS is the very first to explore learning the representation of neuron tree morphology with 
    contrastive learning. It has a great potential to shed new light on quantitative neuron morphology analysis. 

-------

This repository will hold the code for our neuron representation learning framework, named TreeMoCo. 
We aim to bring advanced machine learning techniques for learning neuron morphology qualitatively and quantitatively.

Code is comming soon. 

Maybe we will release a stronger algorithm (extended from original work) upon release.

Stay tuned!
